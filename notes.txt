...and myself when debugging

This code was based on this work.

Get API_KEY

	Need an https POST with this info:
	
		curl -XPOST -H 'x-tc-transform: tti-app' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"username":"EMAIL_ADDRESS","password":"PASSWORD"}' 'https://tti.tiwiconnect.com/api/login'
	
	API_KEY = "result.auth.apiKey" 

	
Get GARAGEDOOR_ID
	//I REALLY DON'T LIKE PUTTING PASSWORD IN THE URL. I can't seem to put the content in a POST request
	https://tti.tiwiconnect.com/api/devices?username=RYOBI_ACCOUNT_EMAIL&password=RYOBI_PASSORD
	
	You will get an array of results, 
		if result[0].deviceTypeIds[1] == `gda500hub`
			GARAGEDOOR_ID = `result[1].varName`
		ELSE // "gdoMasterUnit"
			GARAGEDOOR_ID = `result[0].varName`; // This is my device never tested the other one.

Get STATUS: 
		//I REALLY DON'T LIKE PUTTING PASSWORD IN THE URL. I can't seem to put the content in a POST request
		https://tti.tiwiconnect.com/api/devices/GARAGEDOOR_ID?username=RYOBI_ACCOUNT_EMAIL&password=RYOBI_PASSORD

Send COMMANDS: 
	//Frist need to authorize a web-socket using URL: 'wss://tti.tiwiconnect.com/api/wsrpc'
		Auth Request: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"srvWebSocketAuth","params": {"varName": "EMAIL","apiKey": "API_KEY"}}
	
	This will result in an authorization confirmation, look at "result.authorized".
	You can then send the command on an authorized web-socket.
